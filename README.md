# My-Portfolio

## My Tasks in this project
* I was asked to build a website with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

* I was also asked to put links in the navigation that scrolls to the corresponding first website that I build with image title on it. The images also must be larger than any images in the page template.
* I was also asked to put image link that will lead to the deployed application that I built.


* Lastly, my task is to make it responsive that will adapt the size of small or large screen viewport.

* I build this website using semantic html, Advance CSS, flexbox and mediaqueries.
